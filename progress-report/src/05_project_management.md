# Project Management

The Gantt Chart in Appendix \ref{gantt-chart}. shows the timeline for
completion of the  project. The completion time estimations assume for slight
overages, and any unforeseen issues can make use of the modest contingency time.

As can be seen, the project is significantly behind schedule. This is a
combination of poor estimations and poor time managements, with a good measure
of unexpected difficulties coming up along the way.
