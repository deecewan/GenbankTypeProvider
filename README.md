# GenbankTypeProvider

> A type provider for genetic sequences from Genbank

## Overview

This is a very, very early WIP for a type provider for Genbank.
It aims to provide easy exploration and use of the data Genbank provides, and
allow for type safety while using it.

## Influences

The work on this type provider is designed as a continuation of the work done by
[Jess Davis](https://github.com/jessicagrace17) for her IT Capstone project.
This project uses that work as an inspiration, and I thank Jess for her work in
this space.

[Michael Newton](https://github.com/mavnn) has been of great help through his
[blog post series](http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/type-providers-from-the-ground-up/)

[Don Syme](https://github.com/dsyme) and
[Tomas Petricek](https://github.com/tpetricek) and their many, many articles,
videos and tutorials on Type Providers (and F# in general).

----------

This is my final year thesis project to complete a Bachelor of Engineering
(Computer and Software Systems) at Queensland University of Technology.

The project is under the supervision of
[Assoc. Prof. James Hogan](https://github.com/jamesmhogan).

Eventually, things like my paper will be included in this repository, too.
