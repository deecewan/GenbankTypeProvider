# GenbankTypeProvider

> A type provider for genetic sequences from Genbank

## Overview

This is a very, very early WIP for a type provider for Genbank.
It aims to provide easy exploration and use of the data Genbank provides, and
allow for type safety while using it.

## Influences

The work on this type provider is designed as a continuation of the work done by
Jess Davis (@jessicagrace17) for her IT Capstone project. This project uses that
work as an inspiration, and I thank Jess for her work in this space.

----------

This is my final year thesis project to complete a Bachelor of Engineering
(Computer and Software Systems) at Queensland University of Technology.

The project is under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. James Hogan (@jamesmhogan).

Eventually, things like my paper will be included in this repository, too.
