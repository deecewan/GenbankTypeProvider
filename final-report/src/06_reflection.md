# Reflection

Once again, time management continues to be a cause for concern. Prioritisation of tasks is often wrong. I'll spend too long working on something that has little to no benefit to the project, and neglect parts of the application that could move very quickly with a little bit of work. The logging library, as useful as it is, is a good example of this. It has probably seen close to the same amount of time as the rest of the project combined.

A general lack of understanding of the platform I'm working on makes it difficult to diagnose issues. For an experience person, it may take 10 minutes, or an hour to solve an issue, whereas it will take me hours of research to likely still not come to a good result.  This is evidenced by problems in the build pipeline, though I imagine that confusion over how .NET actually compiles is not a problem unique to me.

It is very evident that the timelines laid out in the project report were
blatantly inaccurate. Estimation of deadlines has never been a strong suit of
mine.  The abundance of red on the updated Gantt chart is evidence of that.
