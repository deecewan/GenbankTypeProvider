The approach easily extends from polymorphic functional languages to imperative languages that provide references, exceptions, continuations, and similar features. We illustrate the technique with a type soundness theorem for the core of Standard ML, which includes the rst type soundness proof for polymorphic exceptions and continuations.},

While several partial solutions to this problem have been proposed, few have been implemented or used. This paper describes an extension to the .NET language F\# called active patterns, which supports pattern matching over abstract representations of generic heterogeneous data such as XML and term structures, including where these are represented via object models in other .NET languages. Our design is the ﬁrst to incorporate both ad hoc pattern matching functions for partial decompositions and “views” for total decompositions, and yet remains a simple and lightweight extension. We give a description of the language extension along with numerous motivating examples. Finally we describe how this feature would interact with other reasonable and related language extensions: existential types quantiﬁed at data discrimination tags, GADTs, and monadic generalizations of pattern matching.},

This leads to an impasse where improvements in programming to aid accuracy and clarity of financial software implementation such as units-of-measure analysis or typed functional programming can't be rolled out to industry. The F\# programming language is increasingly used in implementing financial software and models [1]. It includes a feature called “Type Providers” to support the integration of large-scale information sources into a strongly typed functional-first programming environment. In this tutorial, we show that through the use of this simple, intuitive, scalable and on-demand mechanism called "type providers", we can bridge modern strongly-typed languages to the myriad of heterogeneous data services found in the modern financial programming context - for example entity graphs, databases, web services, spreadsheets and even other programming languages.

Type checking is a way to ensure some level of consistency, depending on the type system, in large programs and in complex assemblies of software components. Type inference provides powerful static analyses of preexisting programs without types, and facilitates the use of type systems by freeing the user from entering type information. In this paper, we investigate the application of these concepts to systems biology. More speciﬁcally, we consider the Systems Biology Markup Language SBML and the Biochemical Abstract Machine BIOCHAM with their repositories of models of biochemical systems. We study three type systems: one for checking or inferring the functions of proteins in a reaction model, one for checking or inferring the activation and inhibition eﬀects of proteins in a reaction model, and another one for checking or inferring the topology of compartments or locations. We show that the framework of abstract interpretation elegantly applies to the formalization of these abstractions and to the implementation of linear time type checking as well as type inference algorithms. Through some examples, we show that the analysis of biochemical models by type inference provides accurate and useful information. Interestingly, such a mathematical formalization of the abstractions used in systems biology already provides some guidelines for the extensions of biochemical reaction rule languages.},

ML and Haskell are two languages where this aspect of compilation has enjoyed some popularity, allowing type information to be omitted while static type checking is still performed. Type inference may be expected to have some application in the prototyping and scripting languages which are becoming increasingly popular. A difficulty with type inference is the confusing and sometimes counter-intuitive diagnostics produced by the type checker as a result of type errors. A modification of the unification algorithm used in Hindley-Milner type inference is presented, which allows the specific reasoning which led to a program variable having a particular type to be recorded for type explanation. This approach is close to the intuitive process used in practice for debugging type errors. The algorithm is practical, and has been implemented in the Standard ML of New Jersey compiler. The modified unification algorithm also appears useful in other domains, including logic program debuggers and semantics-based programming environments.},

@techreport{cardelli_typeful_1989,
	title = {Typeful programming},
	abstract = {There exists an identifiable programming style based on the widespread use of type information handled through mechanical typechecking techniques. This typeful programming style is in a sense independent of the language it is embedded in; it adapts equally well to functional, imperative, object-oriented, and algebraic programming, and it is not incompatible with relational and concurrent programming. The main purpose of this paper is to show how typeful programming is best supported by sophisticated type systems, and how these systems can help in clarifying programming issues and in adding power and regularity to languages. We start with an introduction to the notions of types, subtypes and polymorphism. Then we introduce a general framework, derived in part from constructive logic, into which most of the known type systems can be accommodated and extended. The main part of the paper shows how this framework can be adapted systematically to cope with actual programming constructs. For concreteness we describe a particular programming language with advanced features; the emphasis here is on the combination of subtyping and polymorphism. We then discuss how typing concepts apply to large programs, made of collections of modules, and very large programs, made of collections of large programs. We also sketch how typing applies to system programming; an area which by nature escapes rigid typing. In summary, we compare the most common programming styles, suggesting that many of them are compatible with, and benefit from, a typeful discipline.},
